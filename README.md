# This mini project is about Stone paper and Scissor game

<br>
Made this game by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
<br>
<h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
<br>
Content has four portions :- heading , main content , score board and result message.
<br>
made heading tag by using h1 tag , styled in CSS.
<br>
main content , score board and result message are built by using divs and paragraph.For icon I use image of items.
<br>
<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<br>
First I access the images and result message by using querySelector and addEventListener to each and every choices. Then take all id attributes of choices into a variable userChoice. Then create a function named playGame , here I take userChoice as a argument and I implemented all logic there[to check that please follow the git repo]. After that I create a function showWinner , by which I can change the innerText of HTML docs like updation of scoreboard and keep tracking, showing game result messages.
